Lessons: 
  - Assets folder
      - Images, videos, etc
  - React Native does not have <div> and other things like HTML, we have to use components provided by React Native
      - This is so the elements are converted to their native components based on the device using it
  - Better to use functional components
  - Publishing app to expo so that we can view app offline and not have to deal with app store tediousness
      - Purely for development of course
  - NO CSS
    - Either use inline or StyleSheet Objects written in JavaScript
    - use StyleSheet.create{} for auto-completion and validation
    - Flexbox: Key Concept for layouts
        - Elements are positioned inside containers and controlled by style settings
        - Every view by default uses Flexbox and organises by column
    - Buttons do NOT support styling
    - Styles do NOT cascade
  - Somethings only work on android and not ios and vice versa
      - E.G. Border Radius works on android with a <Text> element but not with IOS so you need to wrap text in <View> to allow it to work on both
  - To change default background colour of all pages in app, go to app.json and add BackgroundColor to object
  - To use StatusBar component you need to wrap code in <> </>
